# HandwritingRecognitionNN

This is a program written to recognise hand-written digits using a neural network with a configurable number of neurons and configurable parameters.

Within the main function, the number of hidden-layer neurons, the batch size, the learning rate and the number of epochs can be modified to test the accuracy of networks created using different parameters.

This program is configured to work with the MNIST hand-written digits dataset.
